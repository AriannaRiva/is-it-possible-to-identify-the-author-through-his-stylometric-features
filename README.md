# is-it-possible-to-identify-the-author-through-his-stylometric-features

This project has been developed with the main idea of trying to solve an authorship identification problem. More specifically, the project is structured in two models: firstly, a DistilBERT transformer model; secondly, a stylometric machine learning model where in addition to the input text, also some stylometric features are considered.

This project deploys two datasets as sources:
- The first one from Mr. Roberto Lofaro on Kaggle , https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/ecb-speeches-1997-to-20191122-frequencies-dm 
-  The second one from the European Central Bank website, https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/html/downloads.en.html

The usage of the following sources in the project is solely for academic statistical purposes. By considering the two above as source, the disclaimer and copyright rules of the European Central Bank website have been followed https://www.ecb.europa.eu/services/disclaimer/html/index.en.html#c
